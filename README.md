# portfolio-module-2
This is my first website made from scratch with HTML and CSS! Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make the link at the bottom of the page a clickable image to the first website we condensed for the first week's challenge. This is my first scratch based assignment, and I would love to hear criticism and any seggusstions/recommendations for improvements!
