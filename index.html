                 <p> I graduated from high school in 2022, and I wanted to jumpstart my career with UTSA's Coding Bootcamp. I had pretty good grades throught my school years, and I have held jobs in retail and in food service. Having not liked any of them, I decided to try coding since I found that I was talented at interpretting codes and understanding what they did.</p>
