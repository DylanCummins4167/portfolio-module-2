                 <p> I graduated from high school in 2022, and I wanted to jumpstart my career with UTSA's Coding Bootcamp. I had pretty good grades throught my school years, and I have held jobs in retail and in food service. Having not liked any of them, I decided to try coding since I found that I was talented at interpretting codes and understanding what they did.</p>
                 <p> I have worked with other developers within the Bootcamp so far, and we created a working browser that gives the users recipies of their favorite foods, as well as nearby local restaurants within their local region. It was our first project and we excelled in the design and the presentation! Here is the deployed site for you to look at!</p>

                        <p1> I found that I was naturally talented in understanding and interpretting codes and I was always fascinated when I thought about how my everyday technologies and websites functioned. The UTSA Coding Bootcamp will teach me all the ins and outs as well as the basics and it will help develop my understanding of coding and I will also get experience in creating my own projects!
